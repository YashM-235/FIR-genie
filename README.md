FIR Generator & Legal Advisor:

🔍 A smart FIR lodging and AI-powered legal advisory platform with live geolocation tracking, developed at LexHack 1.0 through cross-disciplinary collaboration between BTech and Law students.

📌 Overview: 

FIR Generator & Legal Advisor is an innovative web application that allows users to lodge FIRs online with real-time location verification and receive contextual legal advice based on valid FIR records. Built for the LexHack 1.0 legal-tech hackathon, the project was developed by a collaborative team of BTech engineers and law students. While the tech team implemented the platform, the law team provided legal support and defended the application before a jury panel.

Although the project did not secure a top position, it was highly appreciated by both the jury and fellow participants for its real-world utility, responsible use of AI, and technical excellence.

📍 Live Location Tracking: Ensures FIR authenticity via geospatial verification.

🧠 AI-Powered Legal Advice: Integrated with GEMINI AI to provide legal suggestions only when a valid FIR record exists.

⚖️ IPC Section Mapping: Dynamic reference to IPC sections based on FIR content.
